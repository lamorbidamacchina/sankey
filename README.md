# sankey
A tool to generate sankey charts with Google Charts or Amcharts, starting from a simple csv.

## Usage
Download sankey.py and sample.csv and save them in the same folder.

Open your terminal, locate the folder and run

```python3 sankey.py```

The script will create two text files that you can use with [GoogleCharts](https://developers.google.com/chart/interactive/docs/gallery/sankey) and [Amcharts](https://www.amcharts.com/demos/sankey-diagram/)
